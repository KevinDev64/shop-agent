## About The Project

![Screen Shot](images/screenshot.png)

This project is a wonderful prototype of a home appliance selection consultant using an artificial intelligence agent.
And that's why:
* :sparkling_heart: User-friendly interface of the wonderful Telegram messenger
* :blush: Intuitive, well-thought-out bot interface
* :money_with_wings: Easy launch and setup in your own store
* :sparkles: The agent adapts to any incoming data, even user reviews, even characteristics
* :sunglasses: The agent constantly educates himself and strives for the highest ideal 

Many new features will be added over time. The project is waiting for your suggestions for new features or changes :smile:
